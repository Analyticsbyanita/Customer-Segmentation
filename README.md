There are many machine learning algorithms, each suitable for a specific type of problem. One very common machine learning algorithm that’s suitable for customer segmentation problems is the k-means clustering algorithm. There are other clustering algorithms as well such as DBSCAN, Agglomerative Clustering, and BIRCH, etc.
